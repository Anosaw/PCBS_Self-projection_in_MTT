## Self-Projection in Mental Time Travel
Code of my M1 intership

#### dir: scripts  
all scripts used in the experiment  
contains:
  * MTTexp.py = the script for the behavioural experiment. The experiment consists in asking participants to project themselves in the past or in the future at different distances (3, 6 or 9 years). Then, they must make a temporal judgement, i.e. an event from a given list (see documents) is shown on the screen and the participant must judge whether it has already past or is yet to pass (relative to the point of projection). Reaction times are recorded.
  * questionnaire.py = the script for the questionnaire to be filled out by the participants before the experiment. Events are shown to the participants and they must fill the date of the event. Then, they must rate how confident they are in their answer on a scale of 1 to 5. The errors must be taken into account in the analysis.
  * arrows.py = the script that draws the arrows necessary for MTTexp.py
  * timeline.py = the script that draws the timeline used to present the experiment.
